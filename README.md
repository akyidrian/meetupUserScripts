Meetup Userscripts
==================

Userscripts to make Meetup.com a little more awesome. Scripts have been tested in both Greasemonkey (Firefox) and Tampermonkey (Chrome).

displayExtraEventInfo.user.js
-----------------------------

Shows RSVP limits, durations and Google Maps links on the listed events for convenience. Note, information on events from private groups that require signup may not be shown.


filterByAttendeeNumbers.user.js
-------------------------------

Shows/hides events based on number of attendees. Script helps hides listed events that have attendees < min or attendees > max. By default it will show all events.
